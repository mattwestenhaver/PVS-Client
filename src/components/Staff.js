              <h3>Founder & President</h3>
              <p>David began his career managing transportation logistics right out of high school, when he joined the U.S. Air Force and served for 10 years as an Air Traffic Controller. After leaving the military, he went from directing pilots and planes to directing police and fire personnel as an emergency dispatcher for both the Long Beach and the Redondo Beach police departments. He founded Premiere Valet Services in 1988 and credits the leadership skills he gained through the military and his training as an emergency dispatcher for his success in building one of the largest and most trusted valet parking companies in Southern California. Today, Premiere Valet Services employs more than 200 people and has provided  parking services for several U.S. Presidents, countless celebrities, entertainment studios, fundraising galas â€” and even a canine wedding celebration.</p>
